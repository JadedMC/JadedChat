JadedChat is a feature-rich JSON chat plugin for [Paper](http://www.papermc.io) servers running Minecraft 1.19 or later. It allows you to fully customize your chat easily using the [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) format and PlaceholderAPI. It also contains an API to allow developers to have better control over chat without interfering with other plugins.

**This plugin is in early development. The API is likely to change between now and a full release.**
